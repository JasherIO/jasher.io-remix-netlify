Hi, I'm Josh. 

I'm from a suburb of Nashville, Tennessee. 

I graduated from the University of Tennessee with a Master's Degree in Computer Science.

My collegiate education revolved around C/C++ and Python for systems programming and data analysis related courses and projects. 

Most of my undergraduate education 

For my thesis, I created a C++ communication library that interfaced with a novel neural network designed FPGA. My course electives in my last couples of years focused on data analysis in Python. 

Between my senior year and graduate school, I interned at [Cadre5](https://www.cadre5.com/), a local company that focuses on creating custom applications for clients. 

My team developed applications for a nearby Keurig warehouse. I was tasked with creating a product listing in [KnockoutJS](https://knockoutjs.com/), my first introduction to a Javascript Single-Page Application (SPA) framework. 

Since graduation, I have continued to invest time into learning new web frameworks and related concepts, partially by reading documentation and partially by developing projects for esports. I enjoy reading well-written documentation (shout-out to [React](https://reactjs.org/), [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [Remix](https://remix.run/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [FaunaDB](https://fauna.com/), and more). I have probably spent more time than I should reading documentation, but hey, not the worst habit to have.

I am currently working on the Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS) as a referee and statistician.
